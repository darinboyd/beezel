# Beezel
Beezel is a BDD testing framework for Java based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework and JUnit.

Beezel differs from many frameworks in that it is based on a model. Having an upfront EMF model for a the test suite allows for a richer and more flexible information structure than annotation based frameworks.

You can use many conventions found in Gherkin or you can discard them in favor of your own ideas by simply mapping test steps to class methods. A simple code behind model is used in order to avoid complicated configurations.

Beezel was created with teamwork, reporting and project management in mind. Developers, project managers, analyists and other stakeholders will find that their interests are represented as first class citizens in the framework.

Plans for Beezel include a designer, reporting engine and full JDT integration.
